# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This project is meant to help uncover trends in Kickstarter Campaigns such that one is able to make sound decisions about when to launch their campaign and how much they should expect to receive given the type of campaign they are.

### This project is targeted specifically at theater Kickstarter Campaigns in the US and Great Britain.
Within this analysis it was found that 
1. The best time to launch a theater campaign in the US are during the months of May and June. ![timing_kickstarter](path/to/timing_kickstarter.png)
2. The most common and successful Kickstarter campaigns are theater campaigns. ![Picture1](path/to/Picture1.png)
3. For Great Britain musical productions, the amount asked in a campaign was around $4,000, but the amount pledged on average was less than $2,000. ![musical_kickstarter_britain](path/to/musical_kickstarter_britain)

### Recommendations
1. Launch the play campaign during the last two weeks of May into the first two weeks of June 
2. Ask for less during the campaign, the campaigns that failed often asked for too much.
3. Also ask for less for the Great Britain musical campaign.
